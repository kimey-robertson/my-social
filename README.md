# full-stack-app

This is my boilerplate code for a full stack application. 

It's currently sitting at a ERN stack application. There is no database integration as of yet, this will be added soon.

Technologies used:

Front end:
- Create React & Redux app
- React
- Redux
- React-Redux
- Redux toolkit


Back end:
- Node
- Express
- Nodemon
- Morgan
- Body Parser
- CORS
- DOTENV
- Concurrently

It's not perfect, but as time progresses I will update this to be as efficient and as easy possible to start working on your own full stack application,
without all the annoying set up.


Plans to add for future:
- Database integration with MondoDB and/or PostgreSQL
- Authentication and Authorization boilerplate using Passport.js and bcrypt.js
- Optional Typescript version
- Look into using SASS/bootstrap etc.
